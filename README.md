COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data, exploring trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and over time. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations to highlight key insights using Python.

üìå Project Objectives
Import and clean real-world COVID-19 data

Analyze time-based trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)

Compare metrics across countries/regions

Visualize trends using line plots, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots

Summarize findings in a clear, presentable format

üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

(Optional) Plotly or Geopandas for map visualizations

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine or open it in a Jupyter environment.

Make sure pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn are installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Download the COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data and place owid-covid-data.csv in the working directory.

Open and run the notebook or Python script from start to finish to see the analysis and visualizations.

üîç Key Insights
Certain countries had significantly faster vaccine rollouts than others.

Death rates varied by region and wave, showing disparities in healthcare readiness.

New daily cases peaked during certain periods and declined post-vaccination.

Visualizing vaccination progress revealed trends in public health measures' effectiveness.

üí¨ Reflections
This project helped build confidence in handling real-world data. It also reinforced the importance of visualizing trends clearly and deriving meaningful patterns from statistical summaries. Working with time-series data was a valuable learning experience.
